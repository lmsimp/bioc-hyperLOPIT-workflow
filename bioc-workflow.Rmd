# Forward

# Reading and handling mass-spectrometry based proteomics data

## The infrastructre: pRoloc and MSnbase in Bioconductor

## The use-case: prediction sub-cellular localisation in pluripotent embroyonic mouse stem cells

# Normalisation and Quality Control

# Markers

# Novelty Detection

# Supervised machine learning
