# A Bioconductor workflow for processing and analysing spatial proteomics data

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lmsimp/bioc-pRoloc-hyperLOPIT-workflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lmsimp/bioc-pRoloc-hyperLOPIT-workflow)

This workflow describes the detailed analysis of a mouse embryonic
stem cell spatial proteomics dataset using the
[`pRoloc`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/pRoloc.html)
suite of software. The workflow
([this file](https://github.com/lmsimp/bioc-pRoloc-hyperLOPIT-workflow/raw/master/bioc-proloc-hyperlopit.pdf))
has been submitted for peer review to
[F1000research's Bioconductor channel](https://f1000research.com/channels/bioconductor).
