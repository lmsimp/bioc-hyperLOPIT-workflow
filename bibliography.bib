        Abstract = {A challenging task in the study of the secretory pathway is the identification
        and localization of new proteins to increase our understanding of
        the functions of different organelles. Previous proteomic studies
        of the endomembrane system have been hindered by contaminating proteins,
        making it impossible to assign proteins to organelles. Here we have
        used the localization of organelle proteins by the isotope tagging
        technique in conjunction with isotope tags for relative and absolute
        quantitation and 2D liquid chromatography for the simultaneous assignment
        of proteins to multiple subcellular compartments. With this approach,
        the density gradient distributions of 689 proteins from Arabidopsis
        thaliana were determined, enabling confident and simultaneous localization
        of 527 proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuolar
        membrane, plasma membrane, or mitochondria and plastids. This parallel
        analysis of endomembrane components has enabled protein steady-state
        distributions to be determined. Consequently, genuine organelle residents
        have been distinguished from contaminating proteins and proteins
        in transit through the secretory pathway.},

        Abstract = {A major challenge in eukaryotic cell biology is to understand the
        roles of individual proteins and the subcellular compartments in
        which they reside. Here, we use the localization of organelle proteins
        by isotope tagging technique to complete the first proteomic analysis
        of the major organelles of the DT40 lymphocyte cell line. This cell
        line is emerging as an important research tool because of the ease
        with which gene knockouts can be generated. We identify 1090 proteins
        through the analysis of preparations enriched for integral membrane
        or soluble and peripherally associated proteins and localize 223
        proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, lysosome, mitochondrion,
        or plasma membrane by matching their density gradient distributions
        to those of known organelle residents. A striking finding is that
        within the secretory and endocytic pathway a high proportion of proteins
        are not uniquely localized to a single organelle, emphasizing the
        dynamic steady-state nature of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic

@article{Groen:2014,
        Abstract = {Knowledge of protein subcellular localization assists in the elucidation of protein function and understanding of different biological mechanisms that occur at discrete subcellular niches. Organelle-centric proteomics enables localization of thousands of proteins simultaneously. Although such techniques have successfully allowed organelle protein catalogues to be achieved, they rely on the purification or significant enrichment of the organelle of interest, which is not achievable for many organelles. Incomplete separation of organelles leads to false discoveries, with erroneous assignments. Proteomics methods that measure the distribution patterns of specific organelle markers along density gradients are able to assign proteins of unknown localization based on comigration with known organelle markers, without the need for organelle purification. These methods are greatly enhanced when coupled to sophisticated computational tools. Here we apply and compare multiple approaches to establish a high-confidence data set of Arabidopsis root tissue trans-Golgi network (TGN) proteins. The method employed involves immunoisolations of the TGN, coupled to probability-based organelle proteomics techniques. Specifically, the technique known as LOPIT (localization of organelle protein by isotope tagging), couples density centrifugation with quantitative mass-spectometry-based proteomics using isobaric labeling and targeted methods with semisupervised machine learning methods. We demonstrate that while the immunoisolation method gives rise to a significant data set, the approach is unable to distinguish cargo proteins and persistent contaminants from full-time residents of the TGN. The LOPIT approach, however, returns information about many subcellular niches simultaneously and the steady-state location of proteins. Importantly, therefore, it is able to dissect proteins present in more than one organelle and cargo proteins en route to other cellular destinations from proteins whose steady-state location favors the TGN. Using this approach, we present a robust list of Arabidopsis TGN proteins.},
