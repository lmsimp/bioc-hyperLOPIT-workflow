\begin{abstract}
Abstracts should be up to 300 words and provide a succinct summary of the article. Although the abstract should explain why the article might be interesting, care should be taken not to inappropriately over-emphasise the importance of the work described in the article. Citations should not be used in the abstract, and the use of abbreviations should be minimized.
